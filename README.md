# Triggering Mails After 3 Days of Cold Weather
## Context

This example shows how to create a workflow that triggers a promotional email about a tropical vacation after 3 days of cold weather. It can be useful for an agency or anyone who wants to trigger notification based on data from an external API and time factors.

## Prerequisites

- A [Zenaton](https://www.zenaton.com/) account, API id and API key 
- An [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API key
- A [Mailchimp](https://www.google.com/gmail/) account

## Going further

To make this example usable in a real-world production environment, we could:

- Use (lat, long) boxes to pinpoint users in a specific area, not a city
- Add A/B testing in the worklow to increase conversion rate
